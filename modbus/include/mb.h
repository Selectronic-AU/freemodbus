 * This module defines the interface for the application. It contains 
 * the basic functions and types required to use the Modbus protocol stack.
 * A typical application will want to call eMBInit() first. If the device
 * is ready to answer network requests it must then call eMBEnable() to activate
 * the protocol stack. In the main loop the functin eMBPool() must be called 
 * periodically. The time intervall between pooling depends on the configured
 * Modbus timeout. If an RTOS is available a seperate task should be created
 * and the task should always call the function eMBPool(). 
 *
 * \code 
 * // Initialize protocol stack in RTU mode for a slave with address 10 = 0x0A
 * eMBInit( MB_RTU, 0x0A, 38400, MB_PAR_EVEN );
 * // Enable the Modbus Protocol Stack.
 * eMBEnable(  );
 * for( ;; )
 * {
 *     // Call the main polling loop of the Modbus protocol stack.
 *     eMBPool(  );
