\section intro Introduction

The latest version of this document is available on http://freemodbus.berlios.de/api.

FreeModbus is a Modbus ASCII/RTU and Modbus TCP implementation for embedded systems. It provides an implementation of the <em>Modbus Application Protocol v1.1a</em> and supports the RTU/ASCII transmission modes defined in the <em>Modbus over serial line specification 1.0</em>. Since version 0.7 FreeModbus also supports Modbus/TCP.
