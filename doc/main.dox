\section intro Introduction

The latest version of this document is available on http://freemodbus.berlios.de/api.

FreeModbus is a Modbus ASCII/RTU and Modbus TCP implementation for embedded systems. It provides an implementation of the <em>Modbus Application Protocol v1.1a</em> and supports the RTU/ASCII transmission modes defined in the <em>Modbus over serial line specification 1.0</em>. Since version 0.7 FreeModbus also supports Modbus/TCP. Version 0.9 added the first Modbus/TCP port for embedded systems using the <a href="http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/">lwIP</a> TCP/IP stack. 

\section into_port Ports

\par ARM devices:
- STR71X with FreeRTOS/GCC. See STR71X/simple2.c for an example.
- STR71TCP with FreeRTOS/lwIP/GCC. This port includes FreeRTOS, lwIP and a fully working PPP stack. The lwIP, PPP and FreeRTOS part is generic and therefore can be used for other ports ( or other projects ). 

\par AVR devices:
- ATMega8/16/32/128/168/169 with WinAVR. See AVR/demo.c for an example.

\par Coldfire devices:
- MCF5235 with GCC. See MCF5235/demo.c for an example.
- MCF5235/TCP with GCC. This port features FreeRTOS and the lwIP stack. The lwIP part is generic and therefore it should be used as a basis for other lwIP ports.

\par MSP430 devices
- MSP430F169 with Rowley Crossworks. See MSP430/demo.c for an example.
- MSP430F169 with GCC. See MSP430/demo.c for an example.

\par Win32:
- A Win32 Modbus RTU/ASCII Port.
- A Win32 Modbus/TCP Port.

\par Linux:
- A Linux (uCLinux or other distributions) Modbus RTU/ASCII Port.
