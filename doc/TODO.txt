General issues:

 - Parity checking should be used for the characters when received. This
   is not strictly necessary because we use CRC or LRC but it is recommended
   in the standard
   
   Difficulty: easy
   Priority:   low

Function issues:

 - If not initialized the Get Slave ID function must also return the
   run indicator byte in the result and maybe a dummy slave id.

   Difficulty: easy
   Priority:   medium
