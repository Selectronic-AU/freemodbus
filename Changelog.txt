2006-05-01 (REL_0_4) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: This version removes the t1.5 timers from the Modbus RTU
   implementation because no one actually uses it and the CPU
   load is very high.
   In addition some documentation cleanups has been done and the
   ARM demo has been updated.

 Detailed notes:
  - FEATURES: the t1.5 timeout has been removed. Therefore only
     one timer is required.
  - BUG: the ARM demo project missed some files in the project
     workspace and did not compile cleanly
