 Fixed bug in FreeRTOS porting layer for STR71X/lwIP target where memory
 is not freed in the sys_arch_thread_remove function. Synched MCF5235TCP
 port with the FreeRTOS/lwIP port for the STR71X.

 Details:
 - BUG (STR71XTCP): Sys_arch_thread_remove did not free the memory from
   the TCB.
 - BUG (STR71XTCP): Unnecessary call to vTaskSuspendAll removed.
 - BUG (STR71XTCP): Bug with counting variable. The first to lwIP tasks
   got the same name (lwIP0).
 - FEATURE (MCF5235TCP): Enhanced functions from the STR71X/lwIP port
   merged into the Coldfire port.


2006-09-04 (REL_1_0_1) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Fixed bug in serial driver for STR71x target when the ring buffer
 overflows.

 Details:
 - BUG (STR71XTCP): Under high load the ring buffer in the serial driver
   functions might overflow. There was an error with counting the number
   of received characters which corrupted received frames. Now receiver
   correctly recovers in case of dropped bytes.


2006-09-04 (REL_1_0) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Added support for ATmega8, ATmega16, ATmega32, ATmega169 and RS485
 drivers in the AVR support. Special thanks to Tran Minh Hoang for his
 contribution. Added a new lwIP port for the STR71X target which uses
 one serial interface for a PPP connection. This can be used for remote
 Modbus/TCP devices in combination with a Modem (E.g.: GPRS or Analog).

 Details:
 - FEATURES (AVR): Integrated patches from Tran Minh Hoang to support
   the ATmega8, ATmega16, ATmega32, ATmega169 controllers.
 - FEATURES (AVR): Added support for RS485 drivers in the AVR code. The
   example supports the DS76176.
 - FEATURES (STR71XTCP): implemented function in STR71X/lwIP porting
   layer to remove running tasks.
 - FEATURES (STR71XTCP): added new thread creation function in
   STR71X/lwIP porting layer which allows specifing the stack size.
 - BUGS (STR71XTCP): pppOpen defined in ppp.c does not check the return
   value of sys_thread_new. If task creation fails the system crashes.
 - BUGS (STR71XTCP): pppMain must not return - Instead it should remove
   its task from the scheduler.


2006-08-30 (REL_0_9) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Added lwIP port for the MCF5235 target. The lwIP part is generic and
 therefore FreeModbus now works on any target with lwIP support.

 Details:
 - FEATURES: Incoperated MCF5235 FreeRTOS/lwIP port done by the author
   in this project.
 - FEATURES: Added lwIP port for FreeModbus
 - FEATURES: Added demo application for FreeModbus and lwIP.


2006-08-22 (REL_0_8_2) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Fixed bug with Modbus ASCII support

 Details:
 - BUG: During the last upgrade an error was introduced in the
   initialization code of Modbus ASCII and therefore ASCII support was
   broken. The bug is fixed now and was tested with the Win32 port.


2006-08-22 (REL_0_8_1) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Added porting guide

 Details:
 - DOC: Added a new porting guide to the documentation.
 - EXAMPLE: Added a empty example for new ports to the project as a
   starting point.


2006-08-01 (REL_0_8) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Added Linux RTU/ASCII port.

 Details:
 - FEATURES: Added a new Linux RTU/ASCII port. The port should work on
   any Linux distribution and it should be possible to run it on
   uCLinux.


2006-06-26 (REL_0_7) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Changed the WIN32 serial port to better fit into the design.

 Details:
 - REFACTOR: Design of the WIN32 serial port changed. The polling
   function for the serial device are now called from the event loop.
 - REFACTOR: Debugging uses the same interface as the WIN32/TCP port.


2006-06-25 (REL_0_6_3) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Initial work on a Modbus/TCP port is available. The port includes an
 example for a Win32 port which uses the Winsock API.

 Details:
 - FEATURES: added required functions to core protocol stack to support
   a Modbus/TCP implementation.
 - FEATURES: added a Win32 port for the Modbus/TCP core. The port is
   currently limited to one concurrent client.
 - REFACTOR: The implementation of eMBClose to shutdown the protocol
   stack was changed to unify it with the new Modbus/TCP code.


2006-06-18 (REL_0_6_2) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Details:
 - WHITESPACE: while working on the Win32 port some line feeds got
   wrong. Also some source files used tabs instead of spaces.
 - REFACTOR: prototypes for xMBUtilSetBits and xMBUtilGetBits fixed.
   usNBits should be ucNBits by convention.


2006-06-17 (REL_0_6_1) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Fixed various bugs with the Win32 port

 Details:
 - FEATURES: implement shutdown functionality for protocol stack.
 - FEATURES: protocol stack can be enabled and disabled during runtime.
 - FEATURES: interface functions now do more error checking. For example
   if eMBPool is called in an uninitialized state.
 - FEATURES: extended Win32 demo application to use the new features.
 - BUG: fixed bug in Win32 demo for ASCII mode.


2006-06-16 (REL_0_6) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 The new version includes a new port for the Win32 platform

 Details:
 - FEATURES: added Win32 platform


2006-05-14 (REL_0_5) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 The new version includes a new port for the Freescale MCF5235
 processor.

 Details:
 - FEATURES: added new MCF5235 port.
 - REFACTOR: fixed some missing code headers.


2006-05-01 (REL_0_4) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 This version removes the t1.5 timers from the Modbus RTU implementation
 because no one actually uses it and the CPU load is very high. T In
 addition some documentation cleanups has been done and the ARM demo has
 been updated.

 Details:

 - FEATURES: the t1.5 timeout has been removed. Therefore only one timer
   is required.
 - BUG: the ARM demo project missed some files in the project workspace
   and did not compile cleanly


2006-02-28 (REL_0_3_2) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 This version includes support for two new commands (write multiple
 coils, read discrete input)

 Details:
 - BUG: some function used the wrong data types
 - FEATURES: added support for write multiple coils function.
 - FEATURES: added support for read discrete input.
 - REFACTOR: some code cleanups with lint tool.


2006-02-28 (REL_0_3_1) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 The new version 0.3.1 adds support for reading and writing the coil
 registers and add some bug fixes.

 Details:
 - BUG: fixed bug with to small modbus requests being ignored.
 - FEATURES: added support for write single coil function.
 - FEATURES: added support for working with byte packed bit fields to
   support coils and discrete inputs better.
 - API: API for set slave id functions changed.


2006-02-26 (REL_0_3) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 First public release which includes an ARM and AVR port.
