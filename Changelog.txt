2006-08-22 (REL_0_8_1) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Added porting guide

 Details:
 - DOC: Added a new porting guide to the documentation.
 - EXAMPLE: Added a empty example for new ports to the project as a
   starting point.


2006-08-01 (REL_0_8) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Added Linux RTU/ASCII port.

 Details:
 - FEATURES: Added a new Linux RTU/ASCII port. The port should work on
   any Linux distribution and it should be possible to run it on
   uCLinux.


2006-06-26 (REL_0_7) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Changed the WIN32 serial port to better fit into the design.

 Details:
 - REFACTOR: Design of the WIN32 serial port changed. The polling
   function for the serial device are now called from the event loop.
 - REFACTOR: Debugging uses the same interface as the WIN32/TCP port.


2006-06-25 (REL_0_6_3) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Initial work on a Modbus/TCP port is available. The port includes an
 example for a Win32 port which uses the Winsock API.

 Details:
 - FEATURES: added required functions to core protocol stack to support
   a Modbus/TCP implementation.
 - FEATURES: added a Win32 port for the Modbus/TCP core. The port is
   currently limited to one concurrent client.
 - REFACTOR: The implementation of eMBClose to shutdown the protocol
   stack was changed to unify it with the new Modbus/TCP code.


2006-06-18 (REL_0_6_2) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Details:
 - WHITESPACE: while working on the Win32 port some line feeds got
   wrong. Also some source files used tabs instead of spaces.
 - REFACTOR: prototypes for xMBUtilSetBits and xMBUtilGetBits fixed.
   usNBits should be ucNBits by convention.


2006-06-17 (REL_0_6_1) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Fixed various bugs with the Win32 port

 Details:
 - FEATURES: implement shutdown functionality for protocol stack.
 - FEATURES: protocol stack can be enabled and disabled during runtime.
 - FEATURES: interface functions now do more error checking. For example
   if eMBPool is called in an uninitialized state.
 - FEATURES: extended Win32 demo application to use the new features.
 - BUG: fixed bug in Win32 demo for ASCII mode.


2006-06-16 (REL_0_6) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 The new version includes a new port for the Win32 platform

 Details:
 - FEATURES: added Win32 platform


2006-05-14 (REL_0_5) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 The new version includes a new port for the Freescale MCF5235
 processor.

 Details:
 - FEATURES: added new MCF5235 port.
 - REFACTOR: fixed some missing code headers.


2006-05-01 (REL_0_4) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 This version removes the t1.5 timers from the Modbus RTU implementation
 because no one actually uses it and the CPU load is very high. T In
 addition some documentation cleanups has been done and the ARM demo has
 been updated.

 Details:

 - FEATURES: the t1.5 timeout has been removed. Therefore only one timer
   is required.
 - BUG: the ARM demo project missed some files in the project workspace
   and did not compile cleanly


2006-02-28 (REL_0_3_2) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 This version includes support for two new commands (write multiple
 coils, read discrete input)

 Details:
 - BUG: some function used the wrong data types
 - FEATURES: added support for write multiple coils function.
 - FEATURES: added support for read discrete input.
 - REFACTOR: some code cleanups with lint tool.


2006-02-28 (REL_0_3_1) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 The new version 0.3.1 adds support for reading and writing the coil
 registers and add some bug fixes.

 Details:
 - BUG: fixed bug with to small modbus requests being ignored.
 - FEATURES: added support for write single coil function.
 - FEATURES: added support for working with byte packed bit fields to
   support coils and discrete inputs better.
 - API: API for set slave id functions changed.


2006-02-26 (REL_0_3) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 First public release which includes an ARM and AVR port.
