2006-08-22 (REL_0_8_1) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: Added porting guide

 Detailed notes:
   - OTHER: Added a new porting guide to the documentation.
   - OTHER: Added a empty example for new ports to the project as a
       starting point.

2006-08-01 (REL_0_8) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: Added Linux RTU/ASCII port.

 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: Added a new Linux RTU/ASCII port. The port should work
       on any Linux distribution and it should be possible to run it
       on uCLinux.

2006-06-26 (REL_0_7) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: Changed the WIN32 serial port to better fit into the design.

 Detailed notes:
   - OTHER: Design of the WIN32 serial port changed. The polling function
       for the serial device are now called from the event loop.
   - OTHER: Debugging uses the same interface as the WIN32/TCP port.

2006-06-25 Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: Initial work on a Modbus/TCP port is available. The port includes
   an example for a Win32 port which uses the Winsock API.

 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: added required functions to core protocol stack to support
       a Modbus/TCP implementation.
   - FEATURES: added a Win32 port for the Modbus/TCP core. The port is
       currently limited to one concurrent client.
   - OTHER: The implementation of eMBClose to shutdown the protocol stack
       was changed to unify it with the new Modbus/TCP code.

2006-06-18 Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Detailed notes:
   - OTHER: while working on the Win32 port some line feeds got
       wrong. Also some source files used tabs instead of spaces.
   - OTHER: prototypes for xMBUtilSetBits and xMBUtilGetBits fixed.
       usNBits should be ucNBits by convention.

2006-06-17 (REL_0_6_1) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: Fixed various bugs with the Win32 port

 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: implement shutdown functionality for protocol stack.
   - FEATURES: protocol stack can be enabled and disabled during runtime.
   - FEATURES: interface functions now do more error checking. For
       example if eMBPool is called in an uninitialized state.
   - FEATURES: extended Win32 demo application to use the new features.
   - BUG: fixed bug in Win32 demo for ASCII mode.

2006-06-16 (REL_0_6) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: The new version includes a new port for the
   Win32 platform

 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: added Win32 platform

2006-05-14 (REL_0_5) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: The new version includes a new port for the
   Freescale MCF5235 processor.

 Detailed notes:
   - FEATURES: added new MCF5235 port.
   - OTHER: fixed some missing code headers.

2006-05-01 (REL_0_4) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: This version removes the t1.5 timers from the Modbus RTU
   implementation because no one actually uses it and the CPU
   load is very high.
   In addition some documentation cleanups has been done and the
   ARM demo has been updated.

 Detailed notes:
  - FEATURES: the t1.5 timeout has been removed. Therefore only
     one timer is required. 
  - BUG: the ARM demo project missed some files in the project
     workspace and did not compile cleanly

2006-02-28 (REL_0_3_2) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: This version includes support for two new commands
   (write multiple coils, read discrete input)

 Detailed notes:
  - BUG: some function used the wrong datatypes
  - FEATURES: added support for write multiple coils function.
  - FEATURES: added support for read discrete input.
  - OTHER: some code cleanups with lint tool.

2006-02-28 (REL_0_3_1) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: The new version 0.31 adds support for reading and writing the
   coil registers and add some bugfixes.
   
 Detailed notes:
  - BUG: fixed bug with to small modbus requests being ignored.
  - FEATURES: added support for write single coil function.
  - FEATURES: added support for working with byte packed bit fields
     to support coils and discrete inputs better.
  - API: API for set slave id functions changed.

2006-02-26 (REL_0_3) Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>

 Notes: First public release which includes an ARM and AVR port.
